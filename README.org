#+TITLE: xsh.fish
#+LATEX: \pagebreak

* Overview

  [[https://github.com/trogdoro/xiki][Xiki]] includes a wrapper script ~xsh~ that works with many shells, but not
  ~fish~. This module adds a function that works (mostly) the same way.

* Installation

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    fisher install colstrom/xsh.fish
  #+END_SRC

* Differences from reference implementation

  - ~xsh.fish~ does not make any attempt to resolve dependencies. At best, the
    reference implementation was incomplete. It worked with some package
    managers, but not with others. The inconsistency of package names across
    distributions did not help.

* Requirements

  - ruby 1.9.3 or newer
  - emacs 23 or newer
